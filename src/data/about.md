# Intro

I am an aspiring self-directed web3 developer and writer. I am particularly interested in projects that requires fetching API data, creating analytical charts, and web3 development. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I got my hands on a computer when I was 7 years old (2004). Dial-up, modem, telephone cords, tamagotchi. At a ripe young age of 7, I was already playing the first edition of pokemon and diving into the world of video games. I remember being pretty good at pokemon and was lazer-focused on training my charizard to max level. 

- Being brought up by an Asian family, I was brought to many enrichment classes on top of school commitments. Think swimming classes, piano classes, art classes. Funny enough, I think I paid more attention to my co-curricular activities than school itself.

- At 10, I attained my Gold-Star swimming certificate and won some local club medals for swimming. My swimming coach wanted my to join the national team and I had to undergo intense swimming training (4 times a week). The pool I trained in was extremely deep and that was probably what triggered my Thalassophobia.

- At 11, the video game world consumed me. I think I was addicted to gaming (which I didn't know at the time). But my goodness did the world of game development changed during these few years. From 8 bit nintendo/sega games to open world, 2.5D, real-time strategy. Maplestory, Grandchase, Warcraft 3, Audition, Gunbound. I played all the games that was popular at that time.

- At 12, I joined my first singing competition. It was a 3 man team, I didn't know what I was doing, we managed to get first place so that's all that matters. It was a pretty cool experience to be able to perform on stage in front of the whole school but I still thought that the limelight wasn't for me. Aside from compeition and games, I represented my school in various Math and Science Olympiad competitions. I started learning how to play card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Duel Masters and decided to create my own special beyblade. 

- At 14, after being exposed to games for so many years, I aspired to become a pro-gamer. However, my mind was extremely conflicted because I did not like the idea of having to play games for 12 hours a day (scrimming) as I felt like it would take away the fun out of games. I tried to sign up for the local LAN tournament for Dota 2 to try and experience the lifestyle of a pro-gamer but the age limit was 15. Dejected, my friends and I hosted our own school friendly competition every now and then to mimic the life of a pro-gamer.

- At 15, I got my first iPhone. It was an iPhone 4. Being the gamer that I was, I immediately went to Youtube and learn how to jailbreak it. Paid games? I couldn't afford the 99cents. Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, Where's my Water. I also clinched some placing on the world leaderboards of some iPhone puzzle games (Shot Zombie, Infinite Stairs). I also started reading up on Psychology and Philosophy in the local library at the expense of my own grade in school. In addition, I went overseas with my school for the first time in my life! I can't really remember many things right now, but I can remember the feeling of happiness and ecstasy.  

- At 16, I tried Twitch (live-streaming). The experience was ok, but I didn't really have the guts to show myself to the world (introversion, anxiety). I still do want to live-stream sometime though, maybe when I become more confident. I also bought my first Keyboard ever since I stopped going for piano classes at age 11 as I really loved the sound that the piano makes and I wanted to continue learning the piano. Since I could not afford a piano, a keyboard was the alternative. Also, I was a self-created tycoon in Maplestory. I scouted for low-priced items in the market and flipped it for a much higher price, until I managed to attained the max amount of money I could get in the game. This was probably what sparked my investing journey in the later years 

- When I was 17, I decided to switch it up and focus on school life. I joined the Student Council and Symphonic Band in order to know more people. Most of my time was spent in school. My junior college life was pretty fun. Some highlights were going to an overseas exchange trip to Japan with the other Student Leaders, and meeting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in person. I also had the chance to go on a pre-university seminar where I was able to experience living in a university (NUS Prince George's Park) for a week. 

- At 18, I was enlisted into the Army. The first four weeks was rocky because of the extreme change of environment, but I soon got used to it. After my basic military training which lasted around 2 months, I went to Australia with some of my new-found army friends. The rest of my army life was just routine, going to camp and coming back home. I tried to spend my extra time reading books. I remember one book I read was titled 'The October List'. I thought the plot was extremely interesting and bordering on Postmodernistic style. 

- At 19 after reading fiction for almost a year, I decided to switch it up to non-fiction. This moment was my first foray into software development. I remember picking up a book in the library and trying to learn C++, and going absolutely bonkers because I did not understand anything. I started finding resources and chanced upon Udemy, which is an educational platform that I still used up to today. However, at that time I was devouring all the materials without a proper goal in mind. I wanted to be a game developer, a software engineer, a machine learning engineer, a backend developer. The whole time I was pretty much in a disarray, and although its good that I can say now I have touched many languages such as C++ (Unity), Lua (Dota2), Swift (XCode), on hindsight I think it would have been better if I just stuck to one language. 

- At 20 I created a now deprecated Shopify store called NightRoom. It utilized the strategy of Amazon FBA and Dropshipping, something which I was morally unsure whether it was the right thing to do. Interestingly enough, the website was actually pretty successful as I had quite a number of orders. Although I took down the website because of morally grey integrity issues, I did learn a whole lot about marketing. I learned to use Google Analytics, Facebook Marketing, Instagram marketing, conversion rates, PPC, funnellings, all about websites and backlinks, crawlers on Google and how to optimise search result using Google SEO. 

- I entered University at 20 years old, majoring in Philosophy. Philosophy had been something I was always keen about since I was 14 years old, together with Psychology. I wanted to know why the world was like this and what made the world like this. What was(is) the purpose of life, meaning, worth, value, society. Suffice to say I did learn alot and my worldview has changed ever since I enrolled into the course. Aside from the school curriculum, I joined many activities such as chess, swimming, squash, production, volunteering in order to gain new experience and enrich myself. 

- At 23 I started my journey into investing. I learned about the three aspects of analysis, fundemental, sentimental and technical from the books I borrowed in the library, I learned about the life of successful investors such as Charlie Munger, Peter Thiel and Warren Buffett. Some books I recommend are: [Charlie Munger: The Complete Investor](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/Charlie_Munger.html?id=t2ANCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [The 25 Habits of Highly Successful Investors](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/The_25_Habits_of_Highly_Successful_Inves.html?id=rEftDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) I learned about option investing, perpetuals, shorting, fractional investing, and half a year later I stepped foot into the world of cryptocurrency. I have a [medium website](https://cryptostaker.medium.com/) which documented a part of my journey into investing.

- At 24, on the last year of my university, I did my Final Year Project on Technology and Ethics. 

- Now, I have graduated and I have a well-defined track. I always want to do many things, but I realised that being a jack of all traders and a master of none is not going to do me any good. I want to be a master of one, and that would be software development. I have paved the road ahead with the things I need to learn about software development and trying my best to ignore other potential juicy information (solidity, rust programming). For now, I will learn React, Apollo and GraphQL. That's all. My first immediate goal is to master the front-end. I am not going to learn Flask or Django, or even Vue and Angular (although past me would've wanted to learn everything) I am currently on another Udemy course that teach me the basics of these 3 developmental tools.

As I was writing this, I realised that there is so much more that I can write about. My life is pretty interesting although no one knows about it because I don't really talk about myself. Ask me in person for other stories and I will be glad to share more of my life experiences to you.

# Fun facts

- I have a many story ideas that I wish to manifest into a full-fledge novel.
- I still use pen and paper to write notes. I just like the freedom of the page!
- I like to write guides on everything. The earliest guide I wrote was for Dota when I was 13. Since then, I wrote guides about Maplestory, Grandchase, Dota 2, Starcraft II, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm. Splinterlands, Defikingdoms. Most of the guides are deleted because I was embarrassed. Some are still archived and some are still on the web, though!
- I am in 100 discord channels. Most of them are GameFi because I intend to learn the success and shortcomings of GameFi in order to create the best GameFi out there in the future.
- I have 12 Instagram accounts and 8 Youtube accounts. All of them is just me trying out different things. One Instagram account is solely on fitness quotes. Another is a meme page. I am slowly created my arsenal of TikTok accounts.

- Travelling to space.
- Travelling down to the Mariana Trench.
- Writing a book.
