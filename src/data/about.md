# Intro

I am an aspiring self-directed web3 developer and writer. I am particularly interested in projects that requires fetching API data, creating analytical charts, and web3 development. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I got my hands on a computer when I was 7 years old (2004). Dial-up, modem, telephone cords, tamagotchi. At a ripe young age of 7, I was already playing the first edition of pokemon and diving into the world of video games. I remember being pretty good at pokemon and was lazer-focused on training my charizard to max level. 

- At 10, I attained my Gold-Star swimming certificate and won some local club medals for swimming. My swimming coach wanted my to join the national team and I had to undergo intense swimming training (4 times a week). The pool I trained in was extremely deep and that was probably what triggered my Thalassophobia.

- At 12, I joined my first singing competition. It was a 3 man team, I didn't know what I was doing, we managed to get first place so that's all that matters. It was a pretty cool experience to be able to perform on stage in front of the whole school. I also started learning how to play card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Duel Masters and decided to create my own special beyblade. 

- At 14, after being exposed to games for so many years, I aspired to become a pro-gamer, but the age limit was 15. Dejected, my friends and I hosted our own school friendly competition every now and then to mimic the life of a pro-gamer.

- At 15, I got my first iPhone. It was an iPhone 4. Being the gamer that I was, I immediately went to Youtube and learn how to jailbreak it. Paid games? I couldn't afford the 99cents. Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, Where's my Water. I also clinched some placing on the world leaderboards of some iPhone puzzle games (Shot Zombie, Infinite Stairs). 

- At 16, I tried Twitch (live-streaming). I also bought my first Keyboard ever since I stopped going for piano classes at age 11 as I really loved the sound that the piano makes and I wanted to continue learning the piano. 

- When I was 17, I decided to switch it up and focus on school life. I joined the Student Council and Symphonic Band in order to know more people. Most of my time was spent in school. Some highlights were going to an overseas exchange trip to Japan with the other Student Leaders, and meeting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in person. I also had the chance to go on a pre-university seminar where I was able to experience living in a university (NUS Prince George's Park) for a week. 

- At 18, I was enlisted into the Army. After my basic military training which lasted around 2 months, I went to Australia with some of my new-found army friends. The rest of my army life was just routine, going to camp and coming back home. I tried to spend my extra time reading books. After reading fiction for almost a year, I decided to switch it up to non-fiction. This moment was my first foray into software development. I remember picking up a book in the library and trying to learn C++, albeit without much success. Thus, I started finding resources and chanced upon Udemy, which is an educational platform that I still used up to today. I wanted to be a game developer, a software engineer, a machine learning engineer, a backend developer.  

- At 20 I created a now deprecated Shopify store called NightRoom. It utilized the strategy of Amazon FBA and Dropshipping. Interestingly enough, the website was pretty successful as I had quite a number of orders. I did learn a whole lot about marketing. I learned to use Google Analytics, Facebook Marketing, Instagram marketing, conversion rates, PPC, funnellings, all about websites and backlinks, crawlers on Google and how to optimise search result using Google SEO. 

- I entered University at 20 years old, majoring in Philosophy. Philosophy had been something I was always keen about since I was 14 years old, together with Psychology. I wanted to know why the world was like this and what made the world like this. What was(is) the purpose of life, meaning, worth, value, society. Suffice to say I did learn alot and my worldview has changed ever since I enrolled into the course. Aside from the school curriculum, I joined many activities such as chess, swimming, squash, production, volunteering in order to gain new experience and enrich myself. 

- At 23 I started my journey into investing. I learned about the three aspects of analysis, fundemental, sentimental and technical from the books I borrowed in the library, I learned about the life of successful investors such as Charlie Munger, Peter Thiel and Warren Buffett. Some books I recommend are: [Charlie Munger: The Complete Investor](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/Charlie_Munger.html?id=t2ANCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [The 25 Habits of Highly Successful Investors](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/The_25_Habits_of_Highly_Successful_Inves.html?id=rEftDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) I learned about option investing, perpetuals, shorting, fractional investing, and half a year later I stepped foot into the world of cryptocurrency. I have a [medium website](https://cryptostaker.medium.com/) which documented a part of my journey into investing.

- At 24, on the last year of my university, I did my Final Year Project on Artifical Intellignce and Ethics. This thesis is what got me into learning Machine Learning since I had to understand what biases mean in data and how humans can influence machine learning decisions. I also learned about supervised and unsupervised learning and creating different models with the best optimization. You can find it [here](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/browse?type=author&value=Toh%2C+Zhongyan&value_lang=en_US).

- Now, I have graduated and I have a well-defined track. I have paved the road ahead with the things I need to learn about software development. For now, I will learn React, Apollo and GraphQL. That's all. My first immediate goal is to master the front-end. I am currently on another Udemy course that teach me the basics of these 3 developmental tools.

As I was writing this, I realised that there is so much more that I can write about. Ask me in person for other stories and I will be glad to share more of my life experiences to you.

# Fun facts

- I have a many story ideas that I wish to manifest into a full-fledge novel.
- I still use pen and paper to write notes. I just like the freedom of the page!
- I like to write guides on everything. The earliest guide I wrote was for Dota when I was 13. Since then, I wrote guides about Maplestory, Grandchase, Dota 2, Starcraft II, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm. Splinterlands, Defikingdoms. Most of the guides are deleted because I was embarrassed. Some are still archived and some are still on the web, though!
- I am in 100 discord channels. Most of them are GameFi because I intend to learn the success and shortcomings of GameFi in order to create the best GameFi out there in the future.
