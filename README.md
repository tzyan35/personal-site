# Personal Website

See: [mldangelo.com](https://mldangelo.com).

My personal website. An [MIT](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed, simple, easily modifiable, statically-exportable [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) application that deploys automatically for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Built using modern javascript, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), SCSS, [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and many other useful technologies.

## Deploying

### Deploying to Github Pages

1. Modify the environmental variables and git remote url in [`.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/github-pages.yml).
2. Modify `homepage` in `package.json` to point to where you plan to host your site. If you do not plan on using a custom domain name, it should look like `https://[your-gh-username].github.io/[repository-name - default:personal-site]/`
3. If you plan on using a custom domain, modify `public/CNAME`. If you don't, delete `public/CNAME`.

Make a commit to `main` and push your changes. That's it.

### Static Export

To statically export the site without deploying to github pages, delete or disable `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml` and run `npm run predeploy`. This generates a static export of the website as `personal-site/build/`. Copy this and self-host or deploy to a CDN.
